# PhoneGraphs

This repository contains code for in-progress work on using graph-representations of phoneme distributions to learn phonological class systems, and then evaluating those phonological class systems using a new variant of Maximum Entropy phonotactic grammars that fits the MaxEnt Grammar to an n-gram model. 

This repository is made public to be used by other researchers, but is still very much in progress. This is very much research code and is not optimized for either legibility or efficiency - a more efficient and user friendly version will be posted in the near future. 

After cloning the repository, a minimal working example can be run with:

`Run_Template.sh`
